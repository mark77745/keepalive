If you get tired of Microsoft Teams setting you to "Away" when you are sat at your desk reading soemthing work-related or even on a work phone call, then this script is for you!

Presently, Teams will do this if you are not physically typing at your keyboard. I created a C++ application which would get around this and now I've converted this to Python.

This will do two things. Firstly it will pulse the Numlock key to provide keyboard input for Microsoft Teams to classify you as "Available". Secondly, it will put your Windows machine into the right execution state as if it were a PVR. This will keep your PC awake and prevent it going into sleep mode, (useful for those toilet breaks).
